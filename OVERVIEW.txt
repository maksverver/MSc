One graph representation

One parity game representation

Preprocessing steps:
    Vertex reordering (DFS/BFS/reverse/shuffle)
    Priority compression
    Priority propagation
    Cycle removal
    Loop removal
    Decomposition into strongly connected components

Several Small Progress Measures lifting strategies:
    1. Linear
    2. Predecessor
    3. Focus list
    4. Linear/predecessor
    5. "Old" Maximum measure propagation
    6a. Maximum measure propagation
    6b. Minimum measure propagation
    6c. Maximum step propagation

Two Progress Measures representation:
    Dense (single array)
    Sparse (array of pointers -- TODO)
